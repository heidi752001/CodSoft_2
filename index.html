				Resurrection and reckoning among the ancient Egyptians were represented by a scale. 
				The heart of the dead person was placed on one hand and a feather from the goddess Maat was placed on the other hand. 
				The court consisted of 42 judges, as many as the provinces of Egypt. 
				If his heart wins, he enters Paradise [in their view], and if his feather wins, he enters Hell. 
				Hell was depicted in the form of a predatory animal.

				About the Legend
			</h1>
			<p>
				☛ <strong>Egyptian myths</strong> are those sacred stories that the ancient Egyptians believed in. 
				The myth is distinguished by its philosophical depth. 
				Mythology at that time, like science now, was taken for granted in its contents. 
				In most cases, the characters in the myth were gods or demigods, 
				but the presence of humans in them was complementary and nothing more. 
				Myth tells sacred stories that justify the phenomena of nature, 
				for example, the origin of the universe, 
				the creation of man, and other topics addressed by philosophy in particular and the humanities in general. 
				Among the most famous Pharaonic myths are: the Myth of Isis, 
				the Myth of Osiris, the Myth of Set, and the Myth of Horus.<br><br>
				☛ <strong>Origins</strong> is difficult to trace the development of Egyptian myth. 
				Egyptologists must make educated guesses about its early stages based on written sources that appeared later. 
				One clear influence on the myth was the Egyptians' natural surroundings. 
				Each day the sun rose and set, illuminating the land and regulating human activity, 
				and each year the Nile River was flooded to replenish soil fertility 
				and allow for the highly productive agriculture that underpinned Egyptian civilization. 
				Thus the Egyptians saw water and the sun as symbols of life and thought of time as a series of natural cycles. 
				This organized operation was at risk of constant disruption, 
				with unusually low floods leading to famine and high floods destroying crops and buildings. 
				The Nile Valley was surrounded by barren desert inhabited by peoples 
				whom the Egyptians considered to be uncivilized enemies of the regime, 
				and for these reasons the Egyptians saw their land as an isolated place to settle.<br><br>
				☛ <strong>Definition and scope</strong> The basic definition of myth proposed 
				by Egyptologist John Baines is "a central sacred or cultural narrative. 
				"In Egypt, the basic narratives in culture and religion are almost exclusively about events between the gods. 
				Actual accounts of the actions of the gods are rare in Egyptian texts, 
				especially from the early periods, and most references to such events are mere mentions or allusions.<br><br>
				☛ <strong>The Shape of the World</strong> In Egyptian belief, 
				the chaos that preceded the organized world existed outside the world 
				as an infinite expanse of formless water embodied by the god Nun. 
				The earth - personified by the god Geb - is a flat piece of land over 
				which the sky arches and is usually represented by the goddess Nut. 
				The two are separated by air, which is personified by the god Shu. 
				It is said that Ra, the sun god, travels across the sky to energize the world with his light. 
				In the evening, Ra passes beyond the western horizon to Duat, 
				a mysterious region that borders the disembodied region of Nun, 
				and then emerges from the eastern horizon at dawn. 
				The nature of the sky and the location of Duat are uncertain, 
				and Egyptian texts variously describe the night sun 
				as traveling underground and within Nut's body. 
				Egyptologist James B. Allen believes that these explanations for the sun's movements are not similar. 
				In Allen's view, Nut represents the visible surface of the waters of Nun, 
				where the stars float on this surface. 
				So the sun sails across the water in a circle, and every night it passes beyond the horizon to reach the heavens 
				that lie beneath the inverted earth of the Duat. 
				However, Leonard H. Lesko believes that the Egyptians saw the sky 
				as a solid canopy and described the sun 
				as traveling through swirls above the surface of the sky from west to east during the night.<br><br>
				☛ <strong>Time</strong> The Egyptians' view of time was influenced by their environment. 
				Every day the sun rises and sets to illuminate the land and regulate human activity, 
				and every year the waters of the Nile River are flooded, 
				renewing soil fertility and allowing highly productive agriculture, 
				which in turn strengthened Egyptian civilization. 
				These cyclical events inspired the Egyptians to see time as a series of recurring patterns. 
				Many Egyptian stories about the gods are characterized by taking place in a primitive time 
				when the gods were evident on Earth. 
				After this time the Egyptians believed that power on Earth passed to human pharaohs. 
				This primordial bag seems to precede the beginning of the sun's journey 
				and the recurring patterns of the present world, and at the end of time will be the end of those cycles 
				and the annihilation of the world.<br><br>
